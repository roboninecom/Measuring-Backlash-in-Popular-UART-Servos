# A Low-Cost Platform for Measuring Backlash in Popular UART Servos

This repository contains the source code, data analysis scripts, and LaTeX source for the research paper **"A Low-Cost Platform for Measuring Backlash in Popular UART Servos"**.

The project presents an open-source test stand for characterizing backlash in low-cost UART servo actuators (Feetech, Waveshare, etc.) using controlled force application and telemetry logging.

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements

![Test Stand Setup](paper/media_stand/teststand_combined.png)
*Figure: Mechanical test stand used for backlash measurements.*

To reproduce the experiments, you will need:
*   **Servos:** 2x Feetech STS3215 (puller motors) + 1-2 servos for device under test.
*   **Controller:** USB-TTL Adapter (e.g., Feetech or Waveshare USB-TTL) connected to a PC.
*   **Power Supply:** 7.4V or 12V DC power supply (2A minimum).
*   **Mechanical Assembly:** 3D-printed servo holders and 100mm test levers (see paper for details).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Controller Setup (Node.js)

The Node.js application manages the servos, executes motion profiles, and logs telemetry.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (v18+), NPM.

```bash
cd software/backlash_test

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
# Create a .env file or set these manually
export SERIAL_PORT=COM3           # Or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux/Mac
export SERIAL_BAUD_RATE=1000000
```

**Running the Experiment:**

To start the control loop and logging:

```bash
node app.js
```

*   Configuration for motion patterns and servo IDs is located in `sweepConfig.js`.
*   Logs are automatically saved to the `logs/` directory.

### 2. Motor analysis utilities

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, numpy, pandas, plotly.

`log_calc.py` handles motor-analysis scenario by reading a JSON configuration that describes which motors define the analysis phase window, which motors should be reported, and the stretched/relaxed targets for the actuated motors. 

Run the script by passing the config and the log CSV:

```bash
python logs_analysis/log_calc.py logs_analysis/config/config_m1_m2.json /path/to/log.csv
```

`log_viz.py` uses the exact same config files to decide which motors to plot (from `report_motor_ids`) and which actuators provide the relaxed/stretched overlays. Invoke it the same way:

```bash
python logs_analysis/log_viz.py logs_analysis/config/config_m1_m2.json  /path/to/log.csv
```
